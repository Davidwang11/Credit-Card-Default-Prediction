## Introduction

# Research Question
Credit card is now an extremely common mean of transaction that most of the adult consummers possess and utilize these days. It is therefore very important for the credit card issuing comapanies to be able to predict and work with the possibilities of their customers not being able to promptly make default payments. With this on mind, our research question that we aim to answer through this project is: 
Given characteristics (gender, education, age, marriage) and payment history of a customer, is he or she likely to default on the credit card payment next month?
# Data 
The data set that we used was put together by I-Cheng Yeh at the Department of Information Management, Chung Hua University, in Taiwan. The data set itself was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found here. Each row in the data set represents variables associated with a customer and his or her credit card payment information, including a boolean value of default. There are 30,000 observations in the data set and 23 features. There are no observations with missing values or duplicated rows in the data set.
